# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model

# Project Description:
The Titanic Survival Problem is a classic data science challenge aimed at predicting passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, and class. This project focuses on both **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) and **machine learning modeling**.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

**Purpose**: To uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset, providing insights that guide model development.

**Techniques Used**:
**Univariate Analysis**: Examine individual feature distributions.<br/>
**Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between pairs of features, e.g., class vs. survival rate.<br/>
**Multivariate Analysis**: Analyze interactions among multiple features to assess combined effects on survival.<br/>
**Tools**: NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.<br/>
Example: Plotting a correlation matrix to identify feature relationships.<br/>

**Machine Learning Modeling**:

**Pre-processing**: Address missing values, select relevant features, and engineer new features to enhance model performance.<br/>
**Data Preparation**: Split data into training and test sets, and perform feature scaling for consistency.<br/>
**Algorithms**: Apply and compare various models including:<br/>
Logistic Regression<br/>
Decision Trees<br/>
Random Forests<br/>
Support Vector Machines<br/>
K-Nearest Neighbors<br/>
**Evaluation**: Use accuracy and other metrics to determine the best-performing model.<br/>
This approach ensures a robust analysis of factors affecting survival and identifies the most accurate predictive model.<br/>

**Streamlit Integration**:

-> open window powershell and run streamlit run app.py<br/>
    app.py is the file where our strealit integration code is written.
-> This command will start a local server and provide you with a URL to view the app in your web browser, typically http://localhost:8501.

User interface for this code will look like the following:
